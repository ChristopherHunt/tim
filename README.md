Tim is a Magic the Gathering draft AI which is being designed to allow users to
simulate a draft experience virtually prior to their actual draft events. The
current plan is to back Tim's AI with Google's TensorFlow Neural Network package
and to use Magic draft data collected online to train Tim on any given Magic
card set.
