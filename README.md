Tim
====

Tim is a Magic the Gathering draft AI which is being designed to allow users to
simulate a draft experience virtually prior to participating in an actual draft
events (for more information on card drafting in Magic, see [this
link](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/booster-draft)).
The current plan is to back Tim's AI with Google's TensorFlow Neural Network
package and to use Magic draft data collected online to train Tim on any given
Magic card set.

As an aside, naming the bot Tim is a reference to one of the three iconic player
"types" in Magic the Gathering -- namely Timmy. The hope is that Tim will be
slightly better than his younger self and as such will make more "educated and
adult" card choices (as opposed to just grabbing the biggest, shiniest creature
each pack). For more information on the origins of Timmy read [this
